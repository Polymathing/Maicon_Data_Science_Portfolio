# Data Science Bootcamp: Project Overview
• Intended to document my learning progress, covering mainly the topics on Machine Learning and Deep Learning:

• 1. Linear regression: predicting students' performance in college (GPA) based on their previous performance (SAT) and their attendance.

• 2. Logistic Regression:
     a) Bank Case: logistic regression based on the marketing campaign efforts of a Portuguese banking institution.
     b) College Admission: predicting whether a student will be admitted or not, based on previous SAT and College Admission information.

• 3. Cluster Analysis:
     a) Market Segmentation: clustering the data properly, getting insights for future predictions.
     b) Species Segmentation: classical example of clustering based on a well-known dataset, "Species Segmentation, Iris flower".

• 4. Deep Learning: 
     a) MNIST: handwritten digit recognition using the popular Yann LeCun's "MNIST" dataset.  
     b) Audiobooks-Business Case: creating a machine learning algorithm, which is able to predict if a customer will buy again.
     c) Final Project - Absenteeism Predictor: predicting absenteeism from work. The model informs whether or not an employee can be expected to be missing for a specific number         of hours in a given work day.
