# [1. Data Science Bootcamp: Project Overview](https://github.com/Polymathing/365DataScience-Bootcamp)
Project intended to document my learning progress, covering mainly the topics on Machine Learning and Deep Learning:

[Linear regression:](https://github.com/Polymathing/365DataScience-Bootcamp/tree/main/1.%20Linear%20Regression)

• Predicting students' performance in college (GPA) based on their previous performance (SAT) and their attendance.

[Logistic Regression:](https://github.com/Polymathing/365DataScience-Bootcamp/tree/main/2.%20Logistic%20Regression)

a) Bank Case: logistic regression based on the marketing campaign efforts of a Portuguese banking institution.

b) College Admission: predicting whether a student will be admitted or not, based on previous SAT and College Admission information.

[Cluster Analysis:](https://github.com/Polymathing/365DataScience-Bootcamp/tree/main/3.%20Cluster%20Analysis)

a) Market Segmentation: clustering the data properly, getting insights for future predictions.

b) Species Segmentation: classical example of clustering based on a well-known dataset, "Species Segmentation, Iris flower".

[Deep Learning:](https://github.com/Polymathing/365DataScience-Bootcamp/tree/main/4.%20Deep%20Learning)

a) MNIST: handwritten digit recognition using the popular Yann LeCun's "MNIST" dataset.

b) Audiobooks-Business Case: creating a machine learning algorithm, which is able to predict if a customer will buy again.

c) Final Project - Absenteeism Predictor: predicting absenteeism from work. The model informs whether or not an employee can be expected to be missing for a specific number of hours in a given work day.

<h1> 2. HTML, CSS and JavaScript: Basic projects</h1>

These projects are focused on recording my learning progress vis-à-vis the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

[Analisando de Dados:](https://polymathing.github.io/BASIC-HTML-CSS-JS-Analisador/)

• Parses numbers between 1 and 100, generating a summary with the total amount of numbers inserted, their sum, average, max and min.

[Identificador de idade:](https://polymathing.github.io/BASIC-HTML-CSS-JS-Identificador/)

• Identifies one's age providing a related picture according to their year of birth and genre.
